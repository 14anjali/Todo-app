# Todo App

I built a responsive To-Do App that helps users efficiently organize and track daily tasks. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed with an intuitive and clean user interface. The app also includes features like task filtering (All, Active, Completed) and local storage integration to persist data even after refreshing the page.



## Features

✅ Add New Tasks – Quickly add tasks to stay organized.

✏️ Edit Tasks – Update task names anytime.

❌ Delete Tasks – Remove completed or unwanted tasks easily.

☑️ Mark as Completed – Toggle tasks between completed and active states.

🔍 Filter Tasks – View All, Active, or Completed tasks.

💾 Persistent Storage – Tasks are saved in Local Storage, so data remains even after a page refresh.

📱 Responsive Design – Works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

⚡ Optimized Performance – Efficient state updates for a smooth user experience.

🎨 Clean UI – Minimal, intuitive, and distraction-free interface.
